### Analysing morphodynamics of resident tissue macrophages

This is the Python code to analyse the morphology and dynamics of resident tissue macrophages as described in the manuscript 
'Cellular morphodynamics as quantifiers for functional states of resident tissue macrophages in vivo', submitted to and accepted for publication by PLOS Computational Biology.
This code uses the imaging data uploaded to Zenodo at DOI 10.5281/zenodo.13929787, the file main.py uses V(ersion) 1 of the data, while the file main_V2.py uses V(ersion) 2.
Both versions can be found at above DOI. 

To run the code, download the respective data set from Zenodo, change the path to the data set in the file main_V2.py (or main.py) and run it.
