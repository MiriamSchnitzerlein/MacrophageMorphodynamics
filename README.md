### Morphodynamics of resident tissue macrophages

This is the Python code to analyse the morphology and dynamics of resident tissue macrophages as described in the manuscript 
'Cell morphology as a quantifier for functional states of resident tissue macrophages', to be submitted to PLOS Computational Biology.
This code uses the imaging data uploaded to Zenodo at DOI 10.5281/zenodo.10561000
